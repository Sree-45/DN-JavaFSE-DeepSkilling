# Sorting Customer Orders - Complete Guide

## Step 1: Understanding Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort

#### Algorithm Explanation
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list, just like air bubbles rise to the surface of water.

#### How Bubble Sort Works
1. Start with the first element
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements
3. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them
4. Continue this process for the entire array
5. Repeat the process until no swaps are needed

#### Step-by-Step Example
Initial array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

**Pass 1:**
- Compare 64 and 34 → Swap → [34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
- Compare 64 and 25 → Swap → [34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11, 90]
- Compare 64 and 12 → Swap → [34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11, 90]
- Compare 64 and 22 → Swap → [34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11, 90]
- Compare 64 and 11 → Swap → [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]
- Compare 64 and 90 → No swap → [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]

After Pass 1: [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90] (90 is in correct position)

Continue until sorted: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

#### Sample Code
```java
public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    boolean swapped;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        swapped = false;
        
        // Last i elements are already in place
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        
        // If no swapping occurred, array is sorted
        if (!swapped) break;
    }
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n) - when array is already sorted
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²) - when array is reverse sorted
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - only uses constant extra space

### 2. Insertion Sort

#### Algorithm Explanation
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by taking elements from the unsorted portion and inserting them into their correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

#### How Insertion Sort Works
1. Start with the second element (assume first is sorted)
2. Compare current element with previous elements
3. Shift larger elements to the right
4. Insert current element in correct position
5. Repeat for all elements

#### Step-by-Step Example
Initial array: [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]

**Step 1:** [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3] → Take 2, compare with 5, insert before 5 → [2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3]
**Step 2:** [2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 3] → Take 4, insert between 2 and 5 → [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
**Step 3:** [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3] → Take 6, already in correct position → [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]
**Step 4:** [2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3] → Take 1, insert at beginning → [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3]
**Step 5:** [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3] → Take 3, insert between 2 and 4 → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#### Sample Code
```java
public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        
        // Move elements greater than key one position ahead
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        
        // Insert key at correct position
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n) - when array is already sorted
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²) - when array is reverse sorted
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 3. Quick Sort

#### Algorithm Explanation
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it. Elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, elements greater go to the right. The process is recursively applied to sub-arrays.

#### How Quick Sort Works
1. Choose a pivot element from the array
2. Partition the array so elements smaller than pivot are on left, larger on right
3. Recursively apply quicksort to left and right sub-arrays
4. Combine results (no explicit merge needed as sorting is in-place)

#### Step-by-Step Example
Initial array: [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
Choose pivot = 3 (first element)

**Partitioning:**
- Elements < 3: [1, 2, 1]
- Pivot: [3]
- Elements > 3: [6, 8, 10]

**After partition:** [1, 2, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10]

**Recursively sort left part [1, 2, 1]:**
- Pivot = 1, Result: [1, 1, 2]

**Recursively sort right part [6, 8, 10]:**
- Already sorted: [6, 8, 10]

**Final result:** [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]

#### Sample Code
```java
public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        // Partition the array and get pivot index
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
        
        // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

private static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    // Choose rightmost element as pivot
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = (low - 1); // Index of smaller element
    
    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
        }
    }
    
    // Swap arr[i+1] and arr[high] (or pivot)
    int temp = arr[i + 1];
    arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
    arr[high] = temp;
    
    return i + 1;
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n log n) - when pivot divides array into equal halves
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²) - when pivot is always smallest or largest element
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) - due to recursive call stack

### 4. Merge Sort

#### Algorithm Explanation
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together. It guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all cases.

#### How Merge Sort Works
1. Divide the array into two halves
2. Recursively sort both halves
3. Merge the two sorted halves
4. Return the merged sorted array

#### Step-by-Step Example
Initial array: [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]

**Divide:**
```
[38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
       /            \
[38, 27, 43]    [3, 9, 82, 10]
   /    \          /        \
[38]  [27, 43]  [3, 9]   [82, 10]
        /  \      /  \      /   \
      [27] [43]  [3] [9]  [82] [10]
```

**Conquer (Merge):**
```
[27] [43] → [27, 43]
[3] [9] → [3, 9]
[82] [10] → [10, 82]
[38] [27, 43] → [27, 38, 43]
[3, 9] [10, 82] → [3, 9, 10, 82]
[27, 38, 43] [3, 9, 10, 82] → [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
```

#### Sample Code
```java
public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        // Find the middle point
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Sort first and second halves
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);
        
        // Merge the sorted halves
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

private static void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    // Sizes of two subarrays to be merged
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;
    
    // Create temp arrays
    int[] leftArr = new int[n1];
    int[] rightArr = new int[n2];
    
    // Copy data to temp arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)
        rightArr[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];
    
    // Merge the temp arrays
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
            arr[k] = leftArr[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            arr[k] = rightArr[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }
    
    // Copy remaining elements
    while (i < n1) {
        arr[k] = leftArr[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }
    
    while (j < n2) {
        arr[k] = rightArr[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n log n)
- **Average Case:** O(n log n)
- **Worst Case:** O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - requires additional space for temporary arrays

## Step 4: Analysis

### Performance Comparison: Bubble Sort vs Quick Sort

**Time Complexity:**
- **Bubble Sort:** O(n²) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case
- **Quick Sort:** O(n log n) in average case, O(n²) in worst case

**Space Complexity:**
- **Bubble Sort:** O(1) - sorts in-place
- **Quick Sort:** O(log n) - due to recursive calls

**Performance Results from Implementation:**
- Bubble Sort Time: 0.0133 ms
- Quick Sort Time: 0.0097 ms

### Complete Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space | Stable | In-Place |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) | No | Yes |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes | No |

### Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort

1. **Better Average Performance:** Quick Sort has O(n log n) average time complexity compared to Bubble Sort's O(n²), making it significantly faster for larger datasets.

2. **Scalability:** As the dataset size increases, the performance difference becomes more pronounced. Quick Sort scales much better with large amounts of data.

3. **Practical Efficiency:** Despite having the same worst-case complexity as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort's worst case is rare with good pivot selection strategies.

4. **Industry Standard:** Quick Sort is widely used in practice and forms the basis for many standard library sorting implementations.

5. **Adaptive Optimizations:** Quick Sort can be optimized with techniques like median-of-three pivot selection and hybrid approaches for small arrays.

### Algorithm Selection Guidelines

**Bubble Sort:** 
- Educational purposes to understand basic sorting concepts
- Very small datasets (< 10 elements)
- When simplicity of implementation is more important than performance
- When memory usage must be absolutely minimal

**Insertion Sort:** 
- Small datasets
- Nearly sorted data
- Online algorithms (sorting data as it arrives)
- When stable sorting is required and dataset is small

**Quick Sort:** 
- General purpose sorting for large datasets
- When average-case performance matters more than worst-case guarantee
- When memory usage should be minimal (in-place sorting)

**Merge Sort:** 
- When worst-case performance guarantee is needed
- Large datasets where stable sorting is required
- When consistent O(n log n) performance is crucial
- External sorting (when data doesn't fit in memory)

### Practical Considerations

**For E-commerce Order Sorting:**
- **Small number of orders (< 50):** Insertion Sort is sufficient
- **Medium datasets (50-10,000):** Quick Sort is optimal
- **Large datasets (> 10,000):** Merge Sort for guaranteed performance
- **Real-time processing:** Quick Sort for speed
- **Stable sorting required:** Merge Sort to maintain order of equal elements
